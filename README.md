# @srttk/queue ðŸŽ¡

A simplified wrapper around BullMQ for easy queue management in Node.js applications. provides a straightforward way to define, manage, and process queues with minimal boilerplate.

## Features

- Simple queue definition interface
- Type-safe queue processing
- Easy worker management
- Simplified job addition API
- Built on top of robust BullMQ infrastructure

## Installation

```bash
npm install @srttk/queue bullmq
```

## Basic Usage

### 1. Define Your Queue

Create a queue processor by defining a type for your payload and implementing the `IQueueProcess` interface:

```typescript
// greet.ts
import { IQueueProcess } from "@srttk/queue"

type GreetPayload = {
  name: string
}

type Result {
  message: string
}

export const greet: IQueueProcess<GreetPayload, Result> = {
  name: "greet",
  process: async ({ data }) => {

    const message = `Hello ${data.name}`;
    console.log(message)

    // Return result - optional
    return { messsage }
  }
   onCompleted: (job, result) => {
   // Job completed
   console.info(`Job ${job.id} completed `, result)
  },
  onFailed: async (job) => {
    // Job Failed
    console.error(`Job $job.id} failed.`)
  },
}
```

### 2. Create QueueManager Instance

Set up your queue manager with your defined queues:

```typescript
// queue.ts
import { QueueManager } from "@srttk/queue"
import { greet } from './greet'

export default new QueueManager({ greet })
```

### 3. Initialize and Use Queues

In your main application entry point:

```typescript
// app.ts
import queue from "./queue"

async function start() {
  // Initialize queue manager
  await queue.registerQueues();
  await queue.startWorkers();

  // Add job to queue
  await queue.addJob("greet", "my-job", { name: "Luke Skywalker" });
}



start()
```


## Lifecycle Events

The queue system provides comprehensive event handling through various lifecycle hooks. These events allow you to monitor and respond to different states of your jobs and queues.

### Job Events

#### `onCompleted(job: Job, result: any)`
Triggered when a job is successfully completed.
```typescript
onCompleted: (job, result) => {
  console.log(`Job ${job.id} completed with result:`, result);
}
```

#### `onFailed(job: Job, error: Error)`
Triggered when a job fails due to an error.
```typescript
onFailed: (job, error) => {
  console.error(`Job ${job.id} failed:`, error.message);
}
```

#### `onProgress(job: Job, progress: number)`
Triggered when job progress is updated.
```typescript
onProgress: (job, progress) => {
  console.log(`Job ${job.id} is ${progress}% complete`);
}
```

#### `onActive(job: Job)`
Triggered when a job starts processing.
```typescript
onActive: (job) => {
  console.log(`Job ${job.id} has started processing`);
}
```

#### `onStalled(job: Job)`
Triggered when a job is stalled (worker is not responding).
```typescript
onStalled: (job) => {
  console.warn(`Job ${job.id} has stalled`);
}
```

### Queue Events

#### `onReady()`
Triggered when the queue is ready to process jobs.
```typescript
onReady: () => {
  console.log('Queue is ready to process jobs');
}
```

#### `onPaused()`
Triggered when the queue is paused.
```typescript
onPaused: () => {
  console.log('Queue has been paused');
}
```



### Example with Multiple Events

```typescript
export const emailProcessor: IQueueProcess<EmailPayload> = {
  name: "email",
  process: async ({ data }) => {
    // Process email
  },
  onCompleted: (job, result) => {
    console.log(`Email sent successfully: ${job.id}`);
  },
  onFailed: (job, error) => {
    console.error(`Failed to send email: ${error.message}`);
  },
  onProgress: (job, progress) => {
    console.log(`Sending email... ${progress}%`);
  },
  onActive: (job) => {
    console.log(`Starting to send email: ${job.id}`);
  }
}
```

## Graceful shutdown
QueueManager provides a graceful shutdown mechanism to ensure that in-progress jobs are completed and resources are properly released when your application terminates.

```typescript

let signals = ["SIGINT", "SIGTERM"];
signals.map((signal) => {
  process.on(signal, async () => {
    // close all queuee and workers
    await queue.shutdown();
  });
});

```

## Namespace
Namespaces allow you to isolate and group your queues, preventing naming conflicts across different applications or environments. By using namespaces, you can
 - Separate queues for different applications
 - Create isolated environments (development, staging, production)
 - Avoid queue name collisions in shared infrastructure

```typescript

export default new QueueManager({ greet }, { namespace:"app1_development"})

```


## API Reference

### QueueManager

#### Constructor

```typescript
new QueueManager(queues: Record<string, IQueueProcess>)
```

#### Methods

- `registerQueues()`: Initializes all defined queues
- `startWorkers()`: Starts workers for all registered queues
- `addJob(queueName: string, jobId: string, data: any)`: Adds a new job to the specified queue

### IQueueProcess Interface

```typescript
interface IQueueProcess<T> {
  name: string;
  process: (job: { data: T }) => Promise<void>;
}
```

## Configuration

The package uses BullMQ under the hood. You can configure Redis connection settings and other options when initializing the QueueManager (documentation coming soon).

## TypeScript Support

This package is written in TypeScript and includes type definitions. It provides full type safety for your queue payloads and processors.
